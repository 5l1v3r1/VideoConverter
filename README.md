VideoConverter
==============

This is a plug-in for [AutoConvert](https://github.com/unixpickle/AutoConvert) which makes use of the ffmpeg command-line interface.  Using this plug-in, it is easy and straightforward to convert video files in many different containers, and with many different formats.  Currently, this plug-in is in a very early beta stage, such that it is only capable of encoding h.264 video at a pre-defined bitrate.
